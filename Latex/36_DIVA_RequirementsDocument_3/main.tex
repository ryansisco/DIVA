\section{Introduction}
\noindent This section defines the scope and gives a brief, yet comprehensive overview of each module within the Data Interactive Visualization Application, or DIVA web application. Furthermore, this section defines the purpose of the DIVA web application and specifies the definitions of any acronyms or abbreviations that may be used.

    \subsection{System Purpose}
    \noindent The purpose of this document is to give a high level description of the DIVA web application. This document will also describe the reasoning behind the development of the DIVA web application. Furthermore, this document will clarify how the application will interact internally between individual modules, and with any applicable external applications or software. 

    \subsection{System Scope}
    \noindent The DIVA web application is a utility which assists users and stakeholders in collecting, and displaying large data sets in a 3D environment. Further, this application aids in identifying and interpreting the relationships between single objects, or groups of objects, through its interactive 3D user interface. 

    \subsection{System Overview}
    \noindent This subsection will give a more specified overview of the DIVA web application. This overview will include defining the system's context, functionality, and user characteristics. 
        \subsubsection{System Context}
        The DIVA web application is composed of several modules, or elements, of which interact with each other and/or the user in their own manner. The first notable functionality within the web application will be the importing module, which will import a CSV file, provided by the user through the employment of a file explorer. After this operation, the input data will be parsed using a parsing module, which converts the data from a CSV format to a JSON format, making the data easier to handle for later modules. \\
        \newline Every module defined can be grouped into a 'pre-rendering' framework, whereas the modules defined here on out can be grouped into a 'post-rendering' framework, which involves passing the user provided data into a 3D environment. The next element of the DIVA web application can be defined as the rendering module, which passes the JSON data into the WebGL API. The WebGL API will render the data in a 3D environment which the user can both interact with, and view the properties or characteristics of each object and relationship. The final module defined in the DIVA web application will be the export module, which gives the user the ability to download their 3D environment in a variety of formats, including pictures, animations, or movies. 
        \subsubsection{System Functions}
        The DIVA web application will be capable of converting small and large sets of data (for example, a CSV file containing several thousand lines of data) from a CSV file type to JSON format. Additionally, the application will be capable of communicating the JSON data to a WebGL API, which can hold constant user interaction. Lastly, the web application will be capable of downloading the rendered 3D environment into their web browser as a picture (JPEG). \\
        \newline This project is based greatly off of the interaction provided by the user, therefore a great proportion of the application's constraints are dependent on the usability of our software. However, the usability of the DIVA web application will not have hard dependencies on the technical know-how of the user, or in other words, the application user does not need to have any particular expertise in data visualization in order to use this system. 
        \subsubsection{User Characteristics}
        There are several different types of users who may use the DIVA web application. The application is targeted more towards end users who will use this software to present large data sets to clients with the intention of conveying correlations and relationships in the data that could not be seen by simply viewing the raw data. However, this shouldn't restrict other potential users from taking advantage of the DIVA web application's capabilities. No matter if the user is presenting to clients or using it for recreational data visualization, the application user will be presented with the same interfaces. The DIVA web application does not support importing custom made modules for attempting to further the visualization capabilities.

    \textit{DEPENDENCIES:} FR1 - FR8, PR1.

    \subsection{System Interface}
    \noindent The general system interface is a web application, which can be accessed via a browser such as Chrome, Firefox, etc. The application shall be accessible across Windows, Linux, and Mac, as well as Android and IOS with compatible browsers \cite{WebGL}. \newline
    \noindent Specifically, the DIVA web application will contain external interfaces available to the user, as well as internal interfaces available to the modules which collectively make up the application. The external interfaces will include all elements available to the user, including the CSV file import module, 3D environment interaction module, and the media export module. The internal interfaces are defined as the links which internal modules will use to communicate with each other. These will include the modules which parse the CSV file, send the JSON elements (which  cannot  be individually added/removed/edited) to the WebGL API, and convert the user's screen into one or more snapshots which are later converted to media files.
 
\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The CSV file the user uploads has at least 3 columns.
    \item System is error free.
    \item Assume the user is using a browser that supports the application.
    \item Assume that the user has a medium to high-end graphic card to maintain 30 FPS.
    \item The assumption of our project to be considered finish is the user can safely input a CSV file into the Web app. Then, the web app can successfully take the data and render to make a 3D visualization. Furthermore, the user can download the visualization in a JPEG format.
\end{enumerate}
